# Console-Poker

Console-poker is a web application that allows users to chat and play poker real-time! Users can deposit funds into their accounts, join a room, and begin chatting/playing Texas Holdem. Once users are done playing poker, they can head to their bank and withdraw their available winnings.

This repository contains the Back End part of the stack (Rails API)!
